# Spatial Data in R

This is an interactive course on spatial data in R :globe_with_meridians:. It can be run inside e.g. RStudio with the [`swirl`](https://github.com/swirldev)-package ðŸŒŒ. The project is in its development stage. Lessons listed below are already open for learning and testing. Suggestions are very welcome.
